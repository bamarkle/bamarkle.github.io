oldComments = {
1:"Audience: \
\
The audience here is never really explicitly stated. There is an implied reader, sure, but you really do want to hone in on who the author is addressing. What is the audience like? What are their beliefs and/or prejudices? Is this being written for someone who agrees with the author's claim? Or is this an attempt to change a mind? As is, the audience could be more clearly defined.", 


2:"Explicit Connection to Audience: \
\
While you do a nice job of pointing out that certain rhetorical techniques can work on an audience, the key question that needs to be answered is, 'Why would this work on them?' If a rhetorical technique is intended to create an emotion in an audience or, e.g., an appeal to logic, we want to see the evidence that it actually would work (or wouldn't) on that specific listener. To go back to a previous lecture point, different audiences will respond to different appeals differently. To some people, I can point to the forests and the animals and they will see resources to be exploited. To another person I can point to the forests and the animals and they will see nature that needs to be conserved and protected. What we need in this essay is a clearly defined answer - WHY would (or wouldn't) this audience react to the author's words?", 


3:"Background Information: \
\
Your intro, while nice, has a little more background information that the reader probably needs. One of the defining characteristics of academic writing (and partly the reason why it's often very boring) is that scholarly writing tends to be very blunt and to the point. You could probably chop some of this background information and simply get to the meat of the essay (i.e., here's what I'm writing about).", 


4:"Thesis Organization: \
\
Much of this paper has the right stuff. The catch though is that the organization of your ideas is a little off in that your thesis comes entirely too late in the paper. The idea behind a thesis (which can of course be developed further throughout the paper) is that the reader goes into the text having a reasonable idea of what the point is. The problem here is that your reader doesn't get to that thesis until it's a bit too late, i.e., I have read a good bit of your paper before I ever figure out where the essay is going.", 


5:"Mis-identified Vocab Word: \
\
In the essay at least one of your key terms (logos, pathos, ethos, mythos) is not correctly identified in the situation you have supplied. Make sure you have a good grasp on these terms moving forward as we will be employing these techniques in further essays. In short: Logos = logic, Pathos = emotion, Ethos = credibility, Mythos = belief/culture.",


6:"One Idea Per Paragraph: \
\
Some of your paragraphs here are juggling a few ideas at once which can make them difficult for a reader to follow. The general rule in writing is that each idea should equate to a new paragraph. There is no set rule on how long or short a paragraph can be. If you have a new idea, just hit the ENTER key and have at at. Try to organize all your ideas about one topic into one paragraph to keep things tidy.",


7:"Grammar: \
\
There are a few grammatical things here that could be polished up, e.g., fragments, unusual diction choices, punctuation, etc. If grammar isn't your strong suit, you basically have two options: 1) Get a book or look online to bone up on your skills or 2) Find someone you know who's pretty good at writing to have a look over your work with an eye for grammar. I recommend option 2 because you probably have enough to do right now, but you do you.",


8: "Non-uniform Text: \
\
There is at least one instance here where your font color and/or size changes, presumably because you copy/pasted it from somewhere else. Make sure when your copy/pasting that you stick with the original style you chose. The two ways to do this are to right-click and choose 'Paste Without Formatting' or,ter alternatively, when everything is done and written higlight the whole paper (Ctrl + A on a windows PC) and then adjust the font style and color across the whole document.",


9: "Late: \
\
The paper was turned in late. According to the syllabus you should lose a third of a letter grade, but since this is the first paper, we'll let it slide. But try and hit the deadline next time!",


10: "Analysis: \
\
So what you have here in quite a few places is great literary analysis. The catch, though, is that this essay is a rhetorical analysis. We are more concerned with how the author is speaking to the target audience than we are in-depth considerations of things like personification, metaphor, etc. Though analysis of these concepts is great, such an analysis is only relevant if you can explicitly connect it to the author's goal of persuading the target audience.",


11: "New Idea in Conclusion: \
\
Your  conclusion, while great, actually inroduces a new idea to the reader that's actually fairly important to your larger argument as a whole. Don't do that! If you have something important to say (and you certainly did), then give it room to breathe. Put the idea in its own paragraph and explore it a bit. This will allow more space for a proper analysis and also will allow the conclusion to do what it's supposed to do - create a sense of closure.",


12: "Not Enough Context in Intro: \
\
While it can be a bit of a juggling act to create an intro with enough context - how much is too much? Too little? I think this time you erred on the side of too little. This intro is missing some information that would be beneficial for a reader who is trying to understand your paper. Consider adding more detail to flesh out the intro. Specifically, think of a reader who has no familiarity with your chosen text. What is the bare minimum they need to know in order for your paper to make sense? Put that in there!",


13: "Weak Thesis: \
\
Your thesis here doesn't really stake a claim. Instead it asks a question and the paper explores that question, but at no point do you really take a strong stance. There are certain types of papers that that'll work fine for; exploratory papers are valid genres. The catch, though, is that for this particular assignment the prompt asks you to choose a position and argue it. Part of your rhetorical decision-making needs to be able to read the situation and respond accordingly. You need to figure out the audience, what you are trying to convince that audience of, and how best to go about doing it. Here we have a little bit of a misstep in that the purpose of the paper is a little off. ",


14: "Sweeping Generalizations: \
\
Be careful of making statements that are too broad. If your sentences begin with 'Most people...' or something is 'the biggest', 'the best', 'the worst', etc., then you better be prepared to back up that claim with research. Not doing so can undercut your ethos and make the reader dismiss your arguments out of hand if they find exceptions to these large claims. Either try to avoid using grandiose language or, if it's necessary, do be sure to add evidence in the form of citations.",


15: "One-Sided Argument: \
\
One of the chief concepts that we are trying to grasp in this essay is the nature of how resarch works. Ideally, research is a dialogue between you the writer and whatever (or whomever) you are arguing against. This applies both at the micro level (i.e., take the time to explain the research you bring in to defend certain arguments), but also at the macro level. Thoe who might disagree with you or who might object to portions of your paper deserve to have their voice heard, otherwise you are not writing a convincing paper but more of a diatribe. You get up on your soap box and lay out your side of the argument, but don't take the time to acknowledge the other side. Ideally, you want to avoid one-sidedness. By recognizing objections to your argument and responding to them you serve to strengthen your ethos and make a more convincing argument.",


16: "Missing Citation: \
\
You have some information here that could really use some citation to bolster your claims. Any time you are using numbers or really any data that is not common knowledge, you definitely want to cite where you got that information from. Something that is common knowledge would be things like the US Constitution or the fact that Donald Trump is president. Things that need to be cited are any information that a general or your target audience wouldn't know offhand like statistics or anything you had to actually look up yourself. In general it is better to overcite than undercite.",


17: "Transitions and Topic Sentences: \
\
Some of your paragraphs have awkward transitions and/or topic sentences. Try to stay away from flagpost words like 'First, this...Then, that.... And then, this...', and instead try to come up with a way to more seamlessly connect your ideas to the paragraph that comes before. For example, if you were writing about cats vs. dogs as a pet: if you end one paragraph talking about how dogs are better than cats because they are loyal, start the next paragraph with a nod to what you wrote: something like, 'Loyalty is not the only decision-making factor in choosing a pet; the amount of time you must invest is important to consider as well.' This will make the writing flow more smoothly. It's also worth noting that signposting your transitions (first, and then, etc.) isn't necessarily wrong, per se, but it does make writing more robotic sounding.",


18: "Red Herring Argument: \
\
Some of your arguments here are what are called 'red herring' arguments; in short, you don't always adress the issues that the person you are arguing against is and instead bring up a different line of argumentation. While in reality this is a fairly effective tactic (see any presidential debate), generally in a written text you will get called out on this as a logical fallacy. Try to stay on track and make sure you are actually responding to the opposing argument. (e.g., if your opponent argues that 'dogs are more loyal than cats' it would be fallacious to respond with 'but dogs require more maintenance.' This is literally changing the topic.)",


19: "Unnecessary Definitions: \
\
A personal pet peeve of mine to avoid, which also happens to be just general good writing advice, is the inclusion of unnecessary definitions. Students will often take the time to bust out their dictionary to provide the textbook definition of a word - presumably because their audience doesn't know what it means. However, I find that nine times out of ten the word the student is defining is largely unnecessary. Who are you writing to that doesn't know what abortion is? Or murder? Or any of the many ideas students like to define. Ideally, avoid definitions. The only acceptable time to use them is if the exact wording of a textbook definition is vitally important to your argument AND that wording is somewhat esoteric/specific. For example, in my own research I often have to define video games because my working definition is much broader than the conventional, accepted definition (I include interactive fiction, managing my car's gas mileage, and garnering sky miles in my understanding). Because my definition is so different, I usually need to put it in my papers. If, however, I was simply writing an essay on Pac-Man and that was it, I wouldn't need to include an specialized definition.", 


20: "MLA Format: \
\
Some of your MLA formatting is off here. Be sure to check out Purdue's OWL MLA website for specifics on title page, in-text citations, and works cited pages. MLA is not extremely finnicky in its ruleset but you still have to follow the general guidelines. ",


21: "Specific Solution: \
\
While you make some good moves here towards identifying what the problem is and having a general understanding of what needs to be done, your solutions should be more specific. In short, what you have here are good ideas, but not ideas that can be immediately enacted because your reader won't know -specifically- what to do. For example, if you say we should pass a law or we should offer help that's a good start, but the reader needs more. What, specifically will this law say? How do we know it will actually work and do what it's supposed to? What kind of help should be offered, specifically? Be concrete in your details. If I was criticizing a restaurant I shouldn't simply say that they should make better food (though that might be true), but instead I would want to talk about how they should cut down their menu because it's too big, focus on nailing cook times, find more experienced servers, etc. Specific suggestions are more useful to the reader.",


22: "Long Quotes: \
\
Some of your quotes here are little on the long side. 'Long side' for MLA is basically anything more than two lines of printed text. Generally speaking, you should try to keep quotes less than this unless there's a very specific reason that you need that full quote. Acceptable reasons would be that you are going to an extended (read: multi-paragraph/page) analysis of the quote or else the language that the author uses is so precise and important that you need to get every word they are saying. Otherwise, it's best to simply use paraphrasing. Finally, if you absolutely decide that you need a long quote that's four or more lines, you need to use what's called block quoting. Just Google MLA Block Quote Format to see what it looks like.",


23: "Not Final Draft: \
\
It's worth noting that the version you turned in to me was a bit of a working copy; there are still comments attached to this. It's not a huge deal, but do make sure when you are submitting papers both at the university level and also when applying for jobs and such that you remember to submit the polished, cleaned, final version.",


24: "Audience -> Purpose Connection Not Explicit Enough: \
\
One of the big ideas we want to take away from this essay is that idea that the audience you are talking to influences how you approach your purpose; likewise, your purpose should affect your audience. While you make some moves here that demonstrate that you understand that connection, I think there's some room here to be more explicit in thinking of how you address the audience. Do you use first person or third? Which is appropriate for that audience? Do you use formal language or informal? Again, what would that audience most likely respond to? I think this paper definitely begins to toy with these ideas, but ultimately leans a little on being a 'traditional essay' that you could write to just about anybody and it would work. Ideally, an essay (or any communicative act) should be carefully crafted for that one specific audience. Try and think of how you could make this essay better focused towards that audience.",


25: "Purpose/Audience -> Media/Genre Connection Not Explicit Enough: \
\
Another of the big concepts we are considering with the essay and with communication generally is thinking of the way that the message is being delivered, i.e., the medium. As you write, consider what it is you want to say to whom, and what would be the best way to make them understand what you are saying. If you are writing a children's book, consider pictures. If you are discussing music, consider using audio. If you are dissecting a movie, well, it'd be nice to be able to watch the movie, wouldn't it? It's easy to fall into the 'I'm in college so I have to write an essay' mindset, but that does not necessarily make for the most effective communication. Even if you are writing an essay, consider other media such as data and graphs or images that could help your ideas come across even more effectively. (On a side note: as you engage with other teachers and classes, always verify that it's okay to go transmedia with the professor. Some of them are sticks-in-the-mud who are married to the conventional essay.)",


26: "Rhetorical Method of Development (i.e., Organization): \
\
This paper is a bit all over the place and doesn't really adhere strongly to one of the rhetorical methods of devlopment or organizational methods common to writing. Ideally, you should set out ahead of time what model you plan on using (exemplification, procedure, etc.) in the introduction, and then the rest of the essay should follow suit. Instead, this paragraph loses the thread throughout the paper and has paragraphs that don't necessarily belong here. It's also worth noting that even if the paper does follow a rhetorical model hypothetically, if there are paragraphs that include information that is not important to your central thesis, then the model is broken to a degree. Try to figure out how to say what you want to say and stick with the program. Digressions are... well... digressions!",

#Counter Argument
27: "Nailed it!: \
\
We were looking for a well rounded argument that does not simply beat your opponent up, but meaningfully considers his/her argument, lays out what they are saying and why they are saying it, and then offers up a response of your own. This is exactly the kind of move that you'll be wanting to make as you work your way through your other classes and are asked to bring in sources and integrate them with your own thoughts. You do that with aplomb here. Nice job.",


28: "Proposal: \
\
So this project serves as a kind of final exam in a lot of ways. All of the elements that we've covered so far - the rhetorical situation (audience and purpose), the various appeals (logos, mythos, etc.), MLA research, considerations of media and delivery, counterarguments and integrating others' voices - are all at play here. We are looking for a project that shows an understanding of all of these concepts. Ideally you show that you know how to speak to a target audience and present your points and data in such a way as to target them specifically. Why does the problem matter TO THEM? Why do THEY care about your solution. All of the pieces need to point back to that audience.",


29: "Rhetorical Analysis: \
\
This paper is intended to analyze your understanding of our key vocab words (logos, mythos, pathos, ethos, the rhetorical situation, etc.), but also most porominently your understanding that rhetorical techniques do not exist in a vacuum, i.e., their effectiveness is determined and altered by the target audience. Facts and statistics might sway a logically-minded person but have little effect on someone more emotional. Your goal here is to judge the efficacy of the rhetoric of your chosen text. Does it work on the audience? Why or why not? Identifying the vocab words is not enough; we need to know WHY you think those rhetorical strategies are effective or not.",


30: "Investigative Report: \
\
This paper is intended to assess your understanding of the audience -> purpose relationship that is integral to rhetorical studies. Your project needs to be composed with the audience in mind: who are they? What are their beliefs? wants? prejudices? what do they already know about the topic? Additionally, this is the first paper that we'll be looking at MLA and making sure you are able to integrate resources at the most basic level.",


31: "Productve Counter Argument: \
\
This paper is intended to examine your ability to work with - and dialogue with - outside sources. The primary measurement here is your ability to bring in your target article and allow the other side an opportunity to speak. The ICE model - Introduce, Cite, Explain - should be on full display here. We're also looking for you ability to identify and bring in credible sources. These should be sources that are trutworthy with the ability to pinpoint and contact an author if necessary, but don't necessarily need to be scholarly, e.g., found in an academic journal or peer reviewed. Finally, we're also just looking for your ability to create a compelling argument that presents your side of the case fairly and demonstrates some good critical thinking.",

32: "Non-credible or Insufficient Number of Sources: \
\
So while I'm not a huge stickler on sources, this assignment does speciffy that it needs a number of credible sources. What you have here are either sketchy sources or non-existent sources, both of which are not ideal. Pay attention to the essay requirements so you don't get dinged for simple things like this. We're looking for sources that have an author, date, some degree of accountability, are not ad-laden, etc.",

#Proposal
33: "Nailed it!: \
\
Yeah, this looks pretty on point. You've clearly crafted your piece with a target audience in mind, brought in research that would be relevant to them and made arguments based on what they would care about. The research you do have looks pretty solid, and it is integrated in the paper and isn't just dropped in because it was a requirement. You anticipate objections and offer reasonable claims to them. Overall, there's not a whole lot to complain about here. Based on this, I feel like you understand the key concepts of the course. Great job and keep it up!"
